# Date Formats (especially ISO-8601:2019) 
This contains a version of the date parser from re-Isearch designed/intended for use in other projects. Among the changes it uses std:string instead of the re-Isearch's own STRING class.

The basis of the parser is to support the paradigm defined within ISO-8601:2019 and EDTF (the Extended Date Time Format) through a number of common date expresssions including national expressions and those frequently found in emails and other electronic documents.

It contains also a generic version of our slide presentation on the ISO-8601:2019 Date and Time Format Standard. 

This repro (especially the documentation) has been partially supported by a fellowship from
